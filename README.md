## 🔥 Project Overview

**Protecting Yourself Against Wildfires in San Diego** is a community-driven initiative aimed at increasing public awareness and preparedness for wildfires in Southern California. Given the increasing intensity and frequency of wildfires, our project synthesizes research, data visualization, and personal stories to make wildfire safety information more accessible. 

## ❓ Driving Question

**What are the conditions that make a wildfire most likely to occur, and what should people in high-risk areas do to protect themselves?**

Wildfires have become more frequent and severe due to climate change and human activities. Our project seeks to educate individuals and communities by analyzing wildfire patterns, sharing preventive strategies, and presenting real-life stories of resilience and recovery.

## 🎯 Goals & Deliverables

- **Interactive Zine** 📖
  - Contains vital wildfire safety information
  - Includes personal stories of individuals and communities impacted by wildfires
  - Designed to be visually engaging and easy to understand

- **Key Data Insights & Predictors** 🔍
  - Identifies the most significant contributing factors to wildfires
  - Highlights best predictors of wildfire risks
  
- **Community Engagement & Awareness** 🏡
  - Focuses on education for San Diego residents and other wildfire-prone communities
  - Features prevention strategies and safety recommendations

## 📊 Methods & Approach

### **1. Research & Data Collection**
- Aggregating wildfire data from reputable sources, such as CAL FIRE and NOAA.
- Identifying key statistics on wildfire frequency, impact, and prevention.

### **2. Storytelling**
- Sourcing real-world experiences from people in wildfire-prone areas.
- Emphasizing resilience and innovative wildfire prevention strategies.

### **3. Data Visualization & Zine Creation**
- Presenting complex wildfire data in digestible visual formats (graphs, heat maps, before-and-after images).
- Designing a compelling zine using tools like **Canva, Adobe, and Google Slides**.

### **4. Finalization & Distribution**
- Formatting the zine for digital access.
- Hosting it on our project portal for public access.
- Promoting awareness through social media and educational institutions.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- **Residents of San Diego** and other wildfire-prone areas
- **Environmental Advocates & Organizations**
- **Students & Educators** interested in climate resilience
- **General Public** seeking wildfire preparedness resources

## 💾 Dataset Information
### **Description**
The dataset reflects the damage sustained by structures across various fire incidents, categorized by damage percentage—ranging from minor damage (1-10%) to complete destruction (50-100%) and collected by field inspectors who evaluate structures impacted by wildland fires.

This dataset is invaluable for fire prevention, emergency response, and disaster management efforts.

### **Attribute Statement**
This dataset is provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) in collaboration with the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS).

### **No Endorsement Statement**
The publication of this dataset does not imply endorsement by CAL FIRE, NIFC, or any associated entities. The data is provided "as-is" without any guarantees regarding accuracy or completeness.
